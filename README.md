# REACT Hooks CRUD app

A CRUD app built with React hooks, GraphQL and Appollo client on the front end.  

On the backend it's built with Node.js, GraphQL, Express.js, express-graphql, mongoose and MongoDB. 

## Installation

Open the `frontend` folder in the terminal and run npm install.  Do the same thing in the `backend` folder

```
npm install
```

The Frontend can be started by entering 

```
yarn start
```
in the `frontend` terminal


The backend server can be started by entering 

```
npm run dev
```

in the `backend` terminal.

## Notes

I was unable to implement the validation checking on the form fields.  For now it's just using the native HTML validation.

If I had more time I would have added more features such as:

- Check for duplicate entries.

- Force format on phone number.

- Implement a more flexible date input.
